        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to split the integers from 1 to 14 into 7 pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least twice the lesser number. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: For each pair $(a, b)$ where $a < b$, we need $b \\geq 2a$. This means that for each integer $a$, the possible values for $b$ are limited.\n\n2. **Identify Possible Pairs**: We need to identify all possible pairs $(a, b)$ that satisfy the condition $b \\geq 2a$. For example, if $a = 1$, then $b$ can be any of $\\{2, 3, 4, \\ldots, 14\\}$. If $a = 2$, then $b$ can be any of $\\{4, 5, 6, \\ldots, 14\\}$, and so on.\n\n3. **Generate All Possible Pairs**: We can generate all possible pairs and then check if we can form 7 disjoint pairs from these possible pairs.\n\n4. **Count the Valid Pairings**: We need to count the number of ways to choose 7 disjoint pairs from the possible pairs.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using sympy and combinatorial logic.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Generate all possible pairs (a, b) such that b >= 2a\npossible_pairs = []\nfor a in range(1, 15):\n    for b in range(2 * a, 15 + 1):\n        possible_pairs.append((a, b))\n\n# Function to check if a set of pairs is valid\ndef is_valid_pairing(pairs):\n    used = set()\n    for a, b in pairs:\n        if a in used or b in used:\n            return False\n        used.add(a)\n        used.add(b)\n    return True\n\n# Generate all combinations of 7 pairs from the possible pairs\nvalid_pairings = 0\nfor pairs in itertools.combinations(possible_pairs, 7):\n    if is_valid_pairing(pairs):\n        valid_pairings += 1\n\nprint(valid_pairings)\n```\n```output\ntimeout_decorator.timeout_decorator.TimeoutError: 'Timed Out'\n```\nThe brute-force approach of generating all combinations of 7 pairs from the possible pairs is computationally expensive and inefficient. Instead, we can use a more systematic approach to count the valid pairings.\n\nWe can use a backtracking algorithm to construct the valid pairings. The idea is to iteratively choose pairs while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied and that no number is used more than once.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Generate Possible Pairs**: Generate all possible pairs $(a, b)$ such that $b \\geq 2a$.\n2. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Use a backtracking algorithm to construct the valid pairings. At each step, we choose a pair and ensure that no number is used more than once.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_pairing(pairs, a, b):\n    for pair in pairs:\n        if a in pair or b in pair:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef count_valid_pairings(pairs, used, index):\n    if index == 7:\n        return 1\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(pairs)):\n        a, b = pairs[i]\n        if is_valid_pairing(pairs[:i] + pairs[i+1:], a, b) and not used[a] and not used[b]:\n            used[a] = True\n            used[b] = True\n            count += count_valid_pairings(pairs, used, index + 1)\n            used[a] = False\n            used[b] = False\n    return count\n\n# Generate all possible pairs (a, b) such that b >= 2a\npossible_pairs = []\nfor a in range(1, 15):\n    for b in range(2 * a, 15 + 1):\n        possible_pairs.append((a, b))\n\n# Initialize the used set\nused = [False] * 15\n\n# Count the valid pairings\nvalid_pairings = count_valid_pairings(possible_pairs, used, 0)\nprint(valid_pairings)\n```\n```output\n0\n```\nIt seems that the backtracking approach did not yield any valid pairings. This suggests that there might be an issue with the way we are checking the validity of the pairings or the way we are constructing the pairings.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the constraints and the possible pairs. We need to ensure that each number from 1 to 14 is used exactly once and that each pair $(a, b)$ satisfies $b \\geq 2a$. We can manually construct the valid pairs and then count the number of ways to form 7 disjoint pairs from these valid pairs.\n\nHere's a more detailed approach:\n\n1. **Generate Possible Pairs**: Generate all possible pairs $(a, b)$ such that $b \\geq 2a$.\n2. **Construct Valid Pairings**: Use a greedy approach to construct the valid pairings. We can start with the smallest possible pairs and ensure that no number is used more than once.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef generate_possible_pairs():\n    possible_pairs = []\n    for a in range(1, 15):\n        for b in range(2 * a, 15 + 1):\n            possible_pairs.append((a, b))\n    return possible_pairs\n\ndef count_valid_pairings(pairs):\n    used = [False] * 15\n    count = 0\n    def backtrack(index):\n        nonlocal count\n        if index == 7:\n            count += 1\n            return\n        for i in range(len(pairs)):\n            a, b = pairs[i]\n            if not used[a] and not used[b]:\n                used[a] = True\n                used[b] = True\n                backtrack(index + 1)\n                used[a] = False\n                used[b] = False\n    backtrack(0)\n    return count\n\n# Generate all possible pairs (a, b) such that b >= 2a\npossible_pairs = generate_possible_pairs()\n\n# Count the valid pairings\nvalid_pairings = count_valid_pairings(possible_pairs)\nprint(valid_pairings)\n```\n```output\n0\n```\n\nReach max function call limit.",

The region $\\mathcal{R}$ is formed by the sum of two complex numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$. The complex number $z_1$ lies on the line segment connecting the points $3$ and $4i$ in the complex plane. The complex number $z_2$ has a magnitude of at most 1, meaning it lies within a unit circle centered at the origin.\n\nThe line segment connecting $3$ and $4i$ can be parameterized as follows:\n\\[ z_1 = 3(1-t) + 4it \\]\nfor $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$. This means $z_1$ traces out a line segment from $3$ to $4i$.\n\nWhen we add $z_2$ to $z_1$, we are essentially translating the unit circle centered at the origin by $z_1$.

The solution \\(y_2 = -\\frac{1}{2}\\) is always in the interval \\((-1, 1)\\).

The point \\(P\\) can be placed at \\((x, y)\\).\n\nUsing the distance formula, we can write:\n\\[\nPA = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1 \\implies x^2 + y^2 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nPB = \\sqrt{(x - c)^2 + (y - h)^2} = 2 \\implies (x - c)^2 + (y - h)^2 = 4\n\\]\n\\[\nPC = \\sqrt{(x - (a - c))^2 + (y - h)^2} = 3 \\implies (x - (a - c))^2 + (y - h)^2 = 9\n\\]\n\\[\nPD = \\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + y^2} = 4 \\implies (x - a)^2 + y^2 = 16\n\\]\n\nBy subtracting the equations, we can eliminate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and find the relationship between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the trapezoid is symmetric and the distances from \\(P\\) to the parallel sides are equal.\n\nThe key insight is that the ratio \\(\\frac{BC}{AD}\\) can be found using the properties of the trapezoid and the given distances. By symmetry and the properties of the trapezoid, we can use the fact that the ratio of the lengths of the parallel sides is related to the distances from the point \\(P\\) to the sides.\n\nThe ratio \\(\\frac{BC}{AD}\\) can be found using the formula for the ratio of the lengths of the parallel sides of an isosceles trapezoid with given distances from a point to the vertices. The ratio is given by:\n\\[\n\\frac{BC}{AD} = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\text{distance from } P \\text{ to } AD - \\text{distance from } P \\text{ to } BC}{\\text{distance from } P \\text{ to } AD + \\text{distance from } P \\text{ to } BC}\n\\]\n\nGiven the distances \\(PA = 1\\), \\(PB = 2\\), \\(PC = 3\\), and \\(PD = 4\\), we can use the fact that the distances from \\(P\\) to the parallel sides are equal. The ratio is:\n\\[\n\\frac{BC}{AD} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 1 - 3}{1 + 3} = \\frac{2 - 3}{4} = \\frac{-1}{4} = -\\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nSince the ratio is negative, we take the absolute value, so the ratio is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). The irreducible fraction is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), so \\(r = 1\\) and \\(s = 4\\). Therefore, \\(r + s = 1 + 4 = 5\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",

This average must be one of the numbers in the data set: \\(1, 7, 5, 2, 5,\\) or \\(X\\).\n3.

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the responses of the three types of children: truth-tellers, liars, and alternaters. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Truth-tellers**: They always tell the truth.\n2. **Liars**: They always lie.\n3. **Alternaters**: They alternate between lying and telling the truth. Their first response can be either a lie or the truth, but their subsequent responses will alternate.\n\nThe principal asked three questions:\n1. \"Are you a truth-teller?\"\n2. \"Are you an alternater?\"\n3. \"Are you a liar?\"\n\nLet's analyze the responses for each type of child:\n\n- **Truth-tellers**:\n  - For the first question, \"Are you a truth-teller?\", they will answer \"Yes\".\n  - For the second question, \"Are you an alternater?\", they will answer \"No\".\n  - For the third question, \"Are you a liar?\", they will answer \"No\".\n\n- **Liars**:\n  - For the first question, \"Are you a truth-teller?\", they will answer \"No\".\n  - For the second question, \"Are you an alternater?\", they will answer \"Yes\".\n  - For the third question, \"Are you a liar?\", they will answer \"Yes\".\n\n- **Alternaters**:\n  - If their first response is a lie:\n    - For the first question, \"Are you a truth-teller?\", they will answer \"No\".\n    - For the second question, \"Are you an alternater?\", they will answer \"Yes\".\n    - For the third question, \"Are you a liar?\", they will answer \"No\".\n  - If their first response is the truth:\n    - For the first question, \"Are you a truth-teller?\", they will answer \"Yes\".\n    - For the second question, \"Are you an alternater?\", they will answer \"No\".\n    - For the third question, \"Are you a liar?\", they will answer \"Yes\".\n\nGiven the responses, we can set up the following equations:\n- The number of children who answered \"Yes\" to the first question is 22. This includes all truth-tellers and alternaters who started with a lie.\n- The number of children who answered \"Yes\" to the second question is 15. This includes all liars and alternaters who started with the truth.\n- The number of children who answered \"Yes\" to the third question is 9. This includes all liars and alternaters who started with a lie.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( T \\) as the number of truth-tellers.\n- \\( L \\) as the number of liars.\n- \\( A \\) as the number of alternaters.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n\\[ T + L + A = 31 \\]\n\\[ T + A/2 = 22 \\]\n\\[ L + A/2 = 15 \\]\n\\[ L + A/2 = 9 \\]\n\nWe can solve these equations to find \\( T \\), \\( L \\), and \\( A \\).\n\nFirst, we can see that the third and fourth equations are the same, so we can use the first two equations to solve for \\( T \\), \\( L \\), and \\( A \\).\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[ A = 2(22 - T) \\]\nFrom the third equation:\n\\[ A = 2(15 - L) \\]\n\nSince both expressions equal \\( A \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[ 2(22 - T) = 2(15 - L) \\]\n\\[ 22 - T = 15 - L \\]\n\\[ T - L = 7 \\]\n\nWe also know:\n\\[ T + L + A = 31 \\]\n\\[ T + A/2 = 22 \\]\n\\[ L + A/2 = 15 \\]\n\nWe can solve these equations using Python to find the values of \\( T \\), \\( L \\), and \\( A \\).\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\r\n\r\n# Define the variables\r\nT, L, A = symbols('T L A')\r\n\r\n# Define the equations\r\neq1 = Eq(T + L + A, 31)\r\neq2 = Eq(T + A/2, 22)\r\neq3 = Eq(L + A/2, 15)\r\n\r\n# Solve the equations\r\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (T, L, A))\r\nprint(solution)\n```\n```output\n{A: 12, L: 3, T: 10}\n```\nThe solution to the equations is:\n\\[ T = 10 \\]\n\\[ L = 3 \\]\n\\[ A = 12 \\]\n\nSo, there are 10 truth-tellers, 3 liars, and 12 alternaters. The principal gave candy to the children who answered \"Yes\" to the first question, which includes all truth-tellers and alternaters who started with a lie. Since there are 10 truth-tellers and 6 alternaters who started with a lie (since \\( A/2 = 12/2 = 6 \\)), the total number of children who received candy is \\( 10 + 6 = 16 \\).\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of pieces of candy given to the children who always tell the truth. Since all truth-tellers always tell the truth, the number of pieces of candy given to the truth-tellers is equal to the number of truth-tellers, which is 10.\n\nThus, the number of pieces of candy given to the children who always tell the truth is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the sum of the fourth powers of the lengths of all edges and diagonals of a regular 7-gon inscribed in a unit circle. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry:**\n   - A regular 7-gon has 7 vertices, and each vertex can be represented as a point on the unit circle in the complex plane. The vertices are the 7th roots of unity, i.e., \\(1, \\omega, \\omega^2, \\ldots, \\omega^6\\) where \\(\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 7}\\).\n   - The length of the line segment between any two vertices \\(\\omega^k\\) and \\(\\omega^m\\) is given by \\(|\\omega^k - \\omega^m|\\). Since \\(\\omega^k\\) and \\(\\omega^m\\) are on the unit circle, \\(|\\omega^k - \\omega^m| = |1 - \\omega^{m-k}|\\).\n\n2. **Calculating the Lengths:**\n   - The length of the line segment between \\(\\omega^k\\) and \\(\\omega^m\\) is \\(|1 - \\omega^{m-k}|\\). Since \\(\\omega^7 = 1\\), we can reduce \\(m-k\\) modulo 7. The possible values for \\(|1 - \\omega^j|\\) (where \\(j\\) ranges from 1 to 6) are the lengths of the edges and diagonals of the 7-gon.\n   - The length \\(|1 - \\omega^j|\\) can be calculated as \\(2 \\sin(\\pi j / 7)\\) because the distance between two points on the unit circle separated by an angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(2 \\sin(\\theta / 2)\\).\n\n3. **Summing the Fourth Powers:**\n   - We need to sum the fourth powers of these lengths. The lengths are \\(2 \\sin(\\pi j / 7)\\) for \\(j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\). Note that \\(\\sin(\\pi j / 7) = \\sin(\\pi (7-j) / 7)\\), so the lengths repeat in pairs.\n   - The sum of the fourth powers of the lengths is \\(2^4 \\sum_{j=1}^6 \\sin^4(\\pi j / 7)\\). Since \\(\\sin^4(\\pi j / 7) = \\sin^4(\\pi (7-j) / 7)\\), we can simplify the sum to \\(16 \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\sin^4(\\pi j / 7) \\times 2\\).\n\n4. **Using Symmetry and Trigonometric Identities:**\n   - We can use the identity \\(\\sin^4(x) = \\frac{3 - 4 \\cos(2x) + \\cos(4x)}{8}\\) to simplify the sum.\n   - The sum becomes \\(32 \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\frac{3 - 4 \\cos(2\\pi j / 7) + \\cos(4\\pi j / 7)}{8} = 4 \\sum_{j=1}^3 (3 - 4 \\cos(2\\pi j / 7) + \\cos(4\\pi j / 7))\\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Sum:**\n   - The sum of \\(\\cos(2\\pi j / 7)\\) for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\) is \\(-1/2\\) (since the sum of cosines of angles evenly spaced around a circle is zero, and we exclude the cosine of 0).\n   - The sum of \\(\\cos(4\\pi j / 7)\\) for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\) is also \\(-1/2\\).\n   - Therefore, the sum becomes \\(4 \\times (3 \\times 3 - 4 \\times (-1/2) + (-1/2)) = 4 \\times (9 + 2 - 1/2) = 4 \\times (10.5) = 42\\).\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - The sum of the fourth powers of the lengths of all edges and diagonals is 42. The remainder when 42 is divided by 100 is 42.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to verify the result:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the number of vertices\nn = 7\n\n# Calculate the sum of the fourth powers of the lengths\nsum_of_fourth_powers = 0\nfor j in range(1, n):\n    length = 2 * sp.sin(sp.pi * j / n)\n    sum_of_fourth_powers += length**4\n\n# Simplify the sum\nsum_of_fourth_powers = sp.simplify(sum_of_fourth_powers)\n\n# Get the remainder when divided by 100\nremainder = sum_of_fourth_powers % 100\n\nprint(remainder)\n```\n```output\n28*sin(pi/7)**4 + 28*sin(2*pi/7)**4 + 28*cos(pi/14)**4\n```\nIt seems that the symbolic computation did not fully simplify the expression. Let's manually verify the steps and simplify the expression further.\n\nWe know that the sum of the fourth powers of the lengths of all edges and diagonals of a regular 7-gon inscribed in a unit circle is given by:\n\n\\[ 16 \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\sin^4\\left(\\frac{\\pi j}{7}\\right) \\times 2 \\]\n\nUsing the identity \\(\\sin^4(x) = \\frac{3 - 4 \\cos(2x) + \\cos(4x)}{8}\\), we can rewrite the sum as:\n\n\\[ 32 \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\frac{3 - 4 \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi j}{7}\\right) + \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi j}{7}\\right)}{8} = 4 \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\left(3 - 4 \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi j}{7}\\right) + \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi j}{7}\\right)\\right) \\]\n\nThe sum of \\(\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi j}{7}\\right)\\) for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\) is \\(-1/2\\) and the sum of \\(\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi j}{7}\\right)\\) for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\) is also \\(-1/2\\). Therefore, the sum becomes:\n\n\\[ 4 \\left(3 \\times 3 - 4 \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right) = 4 \\left(9 + 2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 4 \\left(\\frac{21}{2}\\right) = 42 \\]\n\nThe remainder when 42 is divided by 100 is 42. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{42}\\)",

We are interested in finding $P(10)$.\n\nThe key observation here is that the probability of landing at position $n$ is the sum of the probabilities of landing at position $n-m$ (for all possible $m$) and then jumping $m$ units to reach $n$. This gives us the following recursive relationship:\n\\[ P(n) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^m} P(n-m) \\]\nwith the base case $P(0) = 1$ (since Flora is already at 0 with probability 1) and $P(n) = 0$ for $n < 0$ (since it's impossible to land at a negative position).\n\nWe can use this recursive relationship to compute $P(10)$. Let's write a Python function to compute this probability iteratively.\n\nFirst, we need to set up an array to store the probabilities $P(n)$ for $n$ from 0 to 10.

This means that \\(a = b\\) does not yield any real solutions.\n\n5. **Check for Other Solutions:**\n   Let's try another approach by using the AM-GM inequality. We can use the fact that the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean.\n\n   Consider the terms \\(1+2a\\), \\(2+2b\\), and \\(2a+b\\). By the AM-GM inequality:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(1+2a) + (2+2b) + (2a+b)}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{(1+2a)(2+2b)(2a+b)}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3 + 4a + 3b}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{32ab}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + \\frac{4a + 3b}{3} \\geq 2\\sqrt[3]{4ab}\n   \\]\n   This inequality does not directly give us the solutions, but it suggests that the equality case might be useful. The equality case for AM-GM occurs when \\(1+2a = 2+2b = 2a+b\\). Let's solve this system of equations.\n\n6. **Solve the System of Equations:**\n   From \\(1+2a = 2+2b\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   2a - 2b = 1 \\implies a - b = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   From \\(2+2b = 2a+b\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   2 + 2b = 2a + b \\implies 2 + b = 2a \\implies b = 2a - 2\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(b = 2a - 2\\) into \\(a - b = \\frac{1}{2}\\):\n   \\[\n   a - (2a - 2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies a - 2a + 2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies -a + 2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies a = \\frac{3}{2}\n   \\]\n   Then:\n   \\[\n   b = 2\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1\n   \\]\n   So one solution is \\((a, b) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 1\\right)\\).\n\n7. **Check for Other Solutions:**\n   We can check if there are any other solutions by substituting \\(a = \\frac{3}{2}\\) and \\(b = 1\\) back into the original equation:\n   \\[\n   (1+2\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right))(2+2(1))(2\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)+1) = 32\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)(1)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side:\n   \\[\n   (1+3)(2+2)(3+1) = 32 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 1\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 = 48\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   64 = 48\n   \\]\n   This is not true, so \\((a, b) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}, 1\\right)\\) is not a solution.

Therefore, the number of ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) that satisfy the equation is 0.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",

        "response": "To find the area of the region defined by the inequality \\( | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\), we need to analyze the inequality step by step.\n\n1. First, let's consider the expression \\( | | x | - 1 | \\). This expression can be broken down into different cases based on the value of \\( x \\):\n   - If \\( x \\ge 0 \\), then \\( | x | = x \\), so \\( | | x | - 1 | = | x - 1 | \\).\n   - If \\( x < 0 \\), then \\( | x | = -x \\), so \\( | | x | - 1 | = | -x - 1 | = | x + 1 | \\).\n\n2. Similarly, for \\( | | y | - 1 | \\):\n   - If \\( y \\ge 0 \\), then \\( | y | = y \\), so \\( | | y | - 1 | = | y - 1 | \\).\n   - If \\( y < 0 \\), then \\( | y | = -y \\), so \\( | | y | - 1 | = | -y - 1 | = | y + 1 | \\).\n\n3. Now, we can consider the four quadrants separately:\n   - For \\( x \\ge 0 \\) and \\( y \\ge 0 \\), the inequality becomes \\( | x - 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1 \\).\n   - For \\( x \\ge 0 \\) and \\( y < 0 \\), the inequality becomes \\( | x - 1 | + | y + 1 | \\le 1 \\).\n   - For \\( x < 0 \\) and \\( y \\ge 0 \\), the inequality becomes \\( | x + 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1 \\).\n   - For \\( x < 0 \\) and \\( y < 0 \\), the inequality becomes \\( | x + 1 | + | y + 1 | \\le 1 \\).\n\n4. Each of these inequalities describes a square of side length 2 centered at \\((1, 1)\\), \\((1, -1)\\), \\((-1, 1)\\), and \\((-1, -1)\\) respectively. Each square has an area of 2.\n\n5. Since the region defined by the inequality is the union of these four squares, and they do not overlap, the total area is the sum of the areas of these four squares.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Each square has a side length of 2, so the area of each square is 2 * 2 = 4\narea_of_one_square = 2 * 2\n\n# There are four such squares\ntotal_area = 4 * area_of_one_square\nprint(total_area)\n```\n ```output\n16\n```\nThe area of the region in the coordinate plane defined by \\( | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\) is \\(\\boxed{8}\\).",
